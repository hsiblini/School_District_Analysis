# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - Analyzing school district data
## Overview
This analysis takes the previous information on high schools and removes 9th grade scores for Thomas High School

## Results
- there are 461 fewer students
- After removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School, the averages in Math and Reading went down marginally.
- Grades 10-12 still had the same averages as they were not affected
- Per student budget is higher as it does not account for the 9th graders. This is likely inaccurate. 

## Summary
The results were as expected, and obtaining the accurate 9th grade scores would give us better information, especially regarding per-student budgets.
